# X-Team NN Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
Play to our group members' strengths while taking into account availabilities 
and levels of comfort. We will also rotate rolls to ensure that everyone is 
developing more a full skill set. 


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
Through communication through text group messages. Create a checklist with deadlines 
and progress notes.


## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
Ask our teamates for help and always be clear what we are having difficulties
with. We will meet up weekly when necessary to resolve conflicts and brainstorm
solutions. If necessary we can use these meetings to redistribute tasks as needed.   

## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
Review code and compare with the deadline checklist. Ensure that no one gets
left behind by volunteering to help eachother when individual tasks are completed 
early.


## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
Be respectful of everyones' abilities and time constraints.
